                  Pathos is an appeal to emotion, and is a way of convincing an audience of an argument by creating an emotional response.

                A private individual who seriously asserts this fallacy risks ending up in a psychiatric

                  <blockquote> Mr. Hixel has no alibi for the evening of January 15th. This proves that

                  In today&rsquo;s America, choosing to remain silent in the face of a police officer&rsquo;s questions can make one guilty enough to be arrested or even shot.

                    The dangerous fallacy that an argument or action is right simply and solely because
                    a respected leader or source (a President, expert, one&rsquo;s parents, one&rsquo;s
                    own &ldquo;side&rdquo;, team or country, one&rsquo;s boss or commanding officers) say it
                    is right. This is over-reliance on authority, a corrupted argument from
                    <span class="def" title="an appeal to ethics">ethos</span> that puts loyalty above truth, above one&rsquo;s own reason and above
                    conscience. In this case a person attempts to justify incorrect, stupid
                    or criminal behavior by whining,
                  <blockquote>That&rsquo;s what I was told to do.</blockquote>
                  <span class="or">Or</span>
                  <blockquote>I was just following orders.</blockquote>
                  A not-uncommon, but extreme, example of this fallacy is the <b>Big Brain/Little Brain Fallacy</b> (also, the <span class="def" title="The Furhrerprinzip prescribed the fundamental basis of political authority in the governmental structures of the Third Reich. This principle can be most succinctly understood to mean that the Führer's word is above all written law and that governmental policies, decisions, and offices ought to work toward the realization of this end.

                  </blockquote>
                  This last fallacy is sometimes expressed in positive terms:
                  <blockquote>You don&rsquo;t have to stress out about the moral rightness or wrongness of
                    your acts since I, the leader, am taking all responsibility. I will
                    defend you and gladly accept all the consequences up to and including

                  <p>A contemporary fallacy that <b>everyone</b> is above average or
                    extraordinary. A corrupted argument from <span class="def" title="an appeal to emotion">pathos</span> (not wanting anyone to
                    lose or to feel bad). Thus, every member of the Armed Services, past
                    or present, who served honorably is a national hero, every student who
                    competes in the Science Fair wins a ribbon or trophy, and every racer
                    is awarded a winner&rsquo;s jersey.
                  </p>
                  <p>This corruption of the argument from pathos, much ridiculed by American
                    comedian <a href="http://www.garrisonkeillor.com/" class="def" title="Born August 7, 1942, as Gary Edward &ldquo;Garrison&rdquo; Keillor, and long-time host of &ldquo;A Prairie Home Companion&rdquo;, on Minnesota Public Radio.">Garrison Keeler</a>, ignores the fact that if everybody
                    wins <em>nobody</em> wins, and if everyone&rsquo;s a hero <em>no one&rsquo;s</em> a hero. The logical result of this fallacy is that, as author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Childress" class="def" title="African-American playwrite, actor, and author. October 12, 1916 – August 14, 1994">Alice Childress</a> writes, &ldquo;A hero ain&rsquo;t nothing but a sandwich&rdquo;.

                </header>
                  <p>A deluded fallacy in which one deliberately chooses not to publicly &lsquo;recognize&rsquo;
                    grounded truth, usually on the theory that this would somehow reward
                    evil-doers if we recognized their deeds as real. Often the underlying
                    theory is that the current situation is &lsquo;temporary&rsquo; and will
                    soon be reversed.
                  </p>
                  <p class="example">Example: In the decades from 1949 until Richard Nixon&rsquo;s time the United
                    States officially refused to recognize the existence of the most populous
                    nation on earth, the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, because America
                    supported the Republic of China government on Taiwan instead and hoped
                    they might return to power on the mainland. More than half a century
                    after the Korean War, the U.S. still refuses to pronounce the name of
                    or recognize a nuclear-armed DPRK (North Korea).
                  </p>
                  <p>An individual who does this risks institutionalization:
                  <blockquote>I refuse to recognize Mom&rsquo;s murder, &lsquo;cuz that would give
                    the victory to the murderer! I refuse to watch you bury her! Stop!
                    Stop!
                  </blockquote>
                  Tragically, such behavior is common in international relations.

                <h3>Positive Thinking Fallacy</h3>
                </header>
                  <p>An immensely popular but deluded modern fallacy of <span class="def" title="an appeal to logic">logos</span>, that because we
                    are &lsquo;thinking positively&rsquo; that in itself somehow biases external,
                    objective reality in our favor even before we lift a finger to act.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Note that this particular fallacy is often part of a much wider closed-minded, sometimes
                    cultish ideology where the practitioner is warned against paying attention
                    to or even acknowledging the existence of &ldquo;negative&rdquo; evidence or counter-arguments
                    against his/her standpoints. In the latter case, rational argument or
                    refutation is most often futile.

                  The ancient fallacy that all who wore a uniform, fought hard and followed orders
                  are worthy of some special honor or glory or are even &ldquo;heroes&rdquo;, whether
                  they fought for freedom or fought to defend slavery, marched under Grant
                  or Lee, Hitler, Stalin or McArthur, fought to defend their homes, fought
                  for oil or to spread empire, or even fought against and killed U.S. soldiers.

                  <h5>Future Ideas</h5>
