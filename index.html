          <p>Fallacies are fake or deceptive arguments, arguments that prove nothing. Fallacies often seem superficially sound, and they far too often retain immense persuasive power even after being clearly exposed as false.</p>

         <p>
            An extremely dangerous fallacy (a deluded argument from <span class="def" title="an appeal to ethics">ethos</span>) asserting that God

            one&rsquo;s own standpoint or actions so no further justification is required
            and no serious challenge is possible.

            The fallacy that since we don&rsquo;t know (or can never know, or cannot prove) whether
            a claim is true or false, it must be false (or that it must be true).

            <blockquote>Scientists are never going to be able to positively prove their theory
               that humans evolved from other creatures, because we weren&rsquo;t there
               to see it! So, that proves the <span class="def" title="">Genesis</span> six-day creation account is literally true as written!</blockquote>

            This fallacy includes <span class="strong">Attacking the Evidence</span>.

            <blockquote>Your evidence is missing, incomplete, or even faked! That proves I&rsquo;m
               right!</blockquote>

            This usually includes <a href="#eitheror">Either-Or Reasoning</a>:
            <blockquote>The vet can&rsquo;t find any reasonable explanation for why my dog died. See!
               See! That proves that you poisoned him! There&rsquo;s no other logical explanation!</blockquote>

            A corrupted argument from <span class="def" title="an appeal to logic">logos</span>. A fallacy commonly found in American political,
            judicial and forensic reasoning.

      <h3>53. Non-Recognition</h3>
      <dt>Description</dt>
      <dd>
         <p>A deluded fallacy in which one deliberately chooses not to publicly &lsquo;recognize&rsquo;
            grounded truth, usually on the theory that this would somehow reward
            evil-doers if we recognized their deeds as real. Often the underlying
            theory is that the current situation is &lsquo;temporary&rsquo; and will
            soon be reversed.</p>

         <p class="example">Example: In the decades from 1949 until Richard Nixon&rsquo;s time the United
            States officially refused to recognize the existence of the most populous
            nation on earth, the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, because America
            supported the Republic of China government on Taiwan instead and hoped
            they might return to power on the mainland. More than half a century
            after the Korean War, the U.S. still refuses to pronounce the name of
            or recognize a nuclear-armed DPRK (North Korea).
         </p>
         <p>An individual who does this risks institutionalization:
            <blockquote>I refuse to recognize Mom&rsquo;s murder, &lsquo;cuz that would give
               the victory to the murderer! I refuse to watch you bury her! Stop!

         At the popular level this also refers to a corrupt argument from ethos in which popular
         support for a standpoint or product is established by a well-known or respected
         figure (e.g. a star athlete or entertainer) who is not an expert and who
         may have been well paid to make the endorsement.

         <blockquote>Olympic gold-medal, pole-vaulter Fulano de Tal uses Quick Flush Internet

        <h2> About The Project</h2>  
         
        <p class="center-block">
        I came across this web page on Reddit and I thought it would be a good starter for a project. I focused on the formatting and the type. Since I started working on it, another 10 fallacies appeared on the site!</p>
        <p>
        None of the terms have been changed from the original site, however there have been style changes and a few minor grammar changes, as needed. In addition, because the original page is a living document, there may be inconsistencies between my version and that one.</p>
