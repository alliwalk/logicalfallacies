# logicalfallacies

I created this project as practice ground for exploring CSS and web typography. The content for this project comes from the Master List of Logical Fallacies. http://utminers.utep.edu/omwilliamson/ENGL1311/fallacies.htm
Improvements include linking between entries, and improved spacing and grouping. I've also used HTML character entities and a semantic structure. The universal definitions are an addition, by me.
