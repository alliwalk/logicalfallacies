# logicalfallacies

I created this project as practice ground for exploring CSS and web typography. 

The content for this project comes from the Master List of Logical Fallacies, which is available for free: http://utminers.utep.edu/omwilliamson/ENGL1311/fallacies.htm

The current site offers very little styling, but it has a number of internal anchor links and is content that I didn't have to write myself. 

I wanted to explore CSS and web typography, and this was a site could be improved with linking between entries, and improved spacing and grouping, color, etc. I've also used HTML character entities and a semantic structure. In addition to the style, I updated the content itself, by adding "universal definitions" which add a bit of context.
